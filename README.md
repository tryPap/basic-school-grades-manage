# Basic Student Management
Student Management with node.js

The user must input name, surname, grade of the student, then push the new student into an array.
You have options to manipulate the data any time.

The data are saved in JSON file so you can use it anywhere.

When you open the app it loads the previous data.

You have to close the app properly so the data will be saved.

You can run the .js file in cmd with node js if you want.
This is a small application that i have made. I am a student of I.IEK VERGI with some months of experience.
